    My name is Michael Neill Hartman

    I create solutions with software.
    
    I live in New Hampshire
    
    I'm an experimental innovator who finds creative solutions to difficult problems.
    
    
    Whenever I attempt a technical task I succeed. 
    
    I have lots of extra-domain knowledge. 
    
    I am extremely eclectic in my ideas and opinions. 
    
    I am always looking to be proven wrong, learn new things, or be afforded a fresh perspective.
    
    I would rather be challenged, than comfortable.
